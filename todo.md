## General Concepts
    - [x] Snap points
    - [ ] Snap points as destinations (points, instead of xy. Basically what we have now with ref)
    - [ ] Snap points to recognize intersections by default?
    - [x] Recognize objects that have been drawn (like circles, paths, rects, lines, points, etc.)
    - [ ] Point/click selection of objects
    - [ ] Expressions (?) as in, draw point at max(some_array) / len(some_array)
        - Probably use Rhai for this
    - [ ] Guides (temporary variables, hidden)
